});

# Setting up Slack

Head on over to the Incoming WebHooks Slack app. If you're signed in to your Slack Workspace you should see an Add Configuration button. Hit it!

Grab the WebHook URL and paste it into the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, which would look like so:

`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXX/YYYYYY/XXXXXXXXXXXX`

You can update 

```js
bot.monitor([
  {
    url: 'https://www.intelligo.systems', // URL of service we'll be pining
    timeout: 200 // threshold in milliseconds above which is considered degraded performance
  }
]);
``` 
with the services you wish to monitor and throw the code up on a server.
